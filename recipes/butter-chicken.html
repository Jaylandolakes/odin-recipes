        <h2>The Velvet Crown Jewel of Indian Cuisine</h2>
        <p>Butter chicken, or "murgh makhani," is a beloved Indian dish that features tender pieces of chicken simmered in a rich, creamy tomato-based sauce. Itâ€™s typically spiced with a blend of garam masala, ginger, garlic, and sometimes fenugreek, creating a harmonious balance of flavors. The sauce is velvety and slightly sweet, with a mild heat that makes it accessible to a wide range of palates.</p>

        <p>The dish originated in the 1950s at the Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi, where leftover chicken was cooked with butter, cream, and tomatoes to prevent waste and create a flavorful meal. Over the years, it has gained immense popularity both in India and around the world, becoming a staple in Indian cuisine. The combination of spices and creamy texture makes butter chicken a comforting and indulgent dish that pairs perfectly with naan or rice.</p>
