        <h2 class="b-main-title-h2">The Velvet Crown Jewel of Indian Cuisine</h2>
        <p>Butter chicken, or "murgh makhani," is a beloved Indian dish that features tender pieces of chicken simmered in a rich, creamy tomato-based sauce. It’s typically spiced with a blend of garam masala, ginger, garlic, and sometimes fenugreek, creating a harmonious balance of flavors. The sauce is velvety and slightly sweet, with a mild heat that makes it accessible to a wide range of palates.</p>

        <p>The dish originated in the 1950s at the Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi, where leftover chicken was cooked with butter, cream, and tomatoes to prevent waste and create a flavorful meal. Over the years, it has gained immense popularity both in India and around the world, becoming a staple in Indian cuisine. The combination of spices and creamy texture makes butter chicken a comforting and indulgent dish that pairs perfectly with naan or rice.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><h3 class="b-title-h3">Marinate the Chicken:</h3></li>

                <p>In a large bowl, combine free-range chicken pieces with Greek yogurt, freshly squeezed lemon juice, grated ginger, minced black garlic, homemade garam masala, fresh turmeric, smoked paprika, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and a pinch of Maldon sea salt.</p>

                <p>Mix well to coat the chicken evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight for maximum flavor.</p>
                <li><h3 class="b-title-h3">Prepare the Sauce:</h3></li>
                
                <p>In a heavy-bottomed pan, melt cultured butter over medium heat. Add finely chopped shallots and sauté until golden and caramelized.
                Add minced garlic and finely chopped Thai green chilies. Sauté for another minute until fragrant.</p> 

                <p>Pour in the San Marzano tomatoes and let it simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the sauce thickens.</p>

                <li><h3 class="b-title-h3">Add Spices:</h3></li>
                
                <p>Stir in fresh bay leaves, green cardamom pods, and a Ceylon cinnamon stick. Let the spices infuse for a couple of minutes.</p>

                <p>Add the marinated chicken to the sauce, including all the marinade. Cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 15-20 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</p>

                <li><h3 class="b-title-h3">Finish the Sauce:</h3></li>
                
                <p>Once the chicken is cooked, remove the whole spices (bay leaves, cardamom, and cinnamon).</p>

                <p>Lower the heat and add heavy whipping cream gradually, stirring to combine. Adjust seasoning with Maldon sea salt and raw cane sugar to balance the flavors.
                For an extra touch, sprinkle in some dried kasuri methi and let it simmer for a few more minutes.</p>

                <li><h3 class="b-title-h3">Serve:</h3></li>
                
                <p>Plate the butter chicken and garnish with micro cilantro.
                Serve with aged basmati rice or artisan naan to soak up the rich sauce.</p>
