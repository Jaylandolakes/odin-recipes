    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The Starbucks Ham & Swiss Baguette is a sandwich made with a crusty, rustic-style baguette filled with sliced ham and Swiss cheese. The bread has a firm and chewy texture, while the ham provides a savory, slightly salty flavor, balanced by the nutty and mild taste of the Swiss cheese. Overall, the sandwich has a classic, simple flavor profile, combining the richness of the cheese with the savory ham, complemented by the crispness of the baguette. Some versions may include mustard or butter for added tang and richness.</p>
