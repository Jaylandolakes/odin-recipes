        <h2>The Golden Embrace of Korean Comfort Food</h2>
            <p>Gyeran Bap (Korean Egg Rice) is a simple and comforting dish made by topping warm rice with a fried egg and seasoning it with soy sauce and sesame oil. The fried egg adds richness and texture, while the soy sauce provides a salty, umami depth. The sesame oil gives it a nutty, aromatic flavor, and optional garnishes like green onions, sesame seeds, and seaweed add extra texture and brightness. Overall, it's a savory, satisfying meal that’s both flavorful and quick to prepare.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooked White Rice: Use short grain rice.</li><br>
            <li>Fried egg: Aim for cooked sunny side up with runny yolks for best results. If you prefer set yolks, go for it, but they won't combine easily with the rest of the ingredients; however, it will still taste quite delicious!</li><br>
            <li>Unsalted butter</li><br>
            <li>Sesame oil: Or replace with chili oil if you're allergic.</li><br>
            <li>Regular soy sauce: Or substitute with low sodium soy sauce or light soy sauce. If you’re gluten-free, substitute with tamari sauce, coconut aminos, or a gluten-free soy sauce of your choice.</li><br>
            <li>Sesame seeds: Omit if allergic.</li><br>
            <li>Green onions</li><br>
            <li>Neutral oil: Like avocado oil, sunflower oil, grapeseed oil, peanut oil, vegetable oil, or canola oil. Avoid olive oil, coconut oil, or any heavy-scented oils. This will be used to cook our egg in the frying pan.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>  
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare Rice</h3></li>

            <p>Mix hot cooked rice with butter until well combined. Transfer rice to a big bowl. If you have leftover rice in the fridge, microwave it for 2-3 minutes until hot. If you don't have rice ready, please refer to the Notes section below on how to cook it.</p>

            <p>Transfer the buttered rice to a large serving bowl. A large bowl will make it easier for mixing and enjoying later.</p>
            
            <li><h3>Prepare Fried Egg</h3></li>

            <p>In a non-stick pan set over medium heat, add cooking oil and fry your egg sunny side up or however you wish. To fry sunny side up: fry the egg until you have nearly-set whites with runny yolks. To help the yolks cook faster, spoon some of the hot oil on top of the yolks.</p>

            <p>Place the egg over top of buttered rice.</p>
            
            <li><h3>Garnish & Mix</h3></li>

            <p>Next sprinkle sesame seeds, sesame oil, chopped green onions, and soy sauce over the top. Feel free to add as much of each ingredient as you wish. This is where you can get really creative by adding other mix-in ideas.</p>

            <p>Mix the egg into the rice along with the other ingredients and enjoy!</p>
        </ol>
